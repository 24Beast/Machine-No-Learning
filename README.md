# Machine-No-Learning
Mobile App platform to create and train machine learning models without any coding. Always expanding and improving.

Who here has not heard of Machine Learning(?)

Just because you have heard of it does not mean you know how to write it's code.
Today we have got software services offered by tons of big name companies offering up cloud platforms and services to facilitate every kind of software solution.
If you wish to utilize data science tools, you have them at your disposal, just click on a few things, specify a few others and voila, everything will happen in the background and you can get a black box which magically does your task for you.

Machine-No-Learning is not like that. We are selecting and offering Machine Learning models in a drag and drop manner which we will then send over to you in the form of python scripts.
Instead of getting a magical blackbox, you get an organized structure of python based scripts (sorry c++ users) along with a batch file to simply double click and run everything (if you wanted the magical blackbox) and/or open-read-understand (by our very generous number of comments) and then execute in your very own local compilers.
